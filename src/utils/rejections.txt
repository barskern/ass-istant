Brain’s on low-power mode.
Emotional battery at 1%.
We’ve been here before.
See previous episode.
Ask me again never.
Wrong headspace, sorry.
Currently overwhelmed, brb never.
I don’t have explanation energy.
That answer needs a prequel trilogy.
That’s a whole essay.
That’s a bit nosy.
That’s classified information.
Not feeling conversational today.
My attention left the building.
Do we really need this?
You already know the answer.
Try again with punctuation.
That feels loaded.
Bold assumption there.
That sounded judgey.
Dealing with other chaos.
Anxiety says no.
I’m one question away from snapping.
Burnt. Out.
Not opening that thread.
Not here to spar.
Debate mode is off.
I don’t owe a defense.
Not doing a tutorial today.
This question annoys me more than it should.
That’s a nope for emotional reasons.
That felt rude, honestly.
Hard pass on the tone.
Demands detected, shutting down.
Feels like bait.
I don’t buy the sincerity.
Missing too many details.
Too many details, actually.
I already feel misunderstood.
History says this won’t land.
This would go unappreciated.
It wouldn’t change anything.
This would be ignored anyway.
That would get twisted.
That’d be quoted wrong.
That’s how fights start.
That’s a follow-up trap.
Not opening that door.
Retired topic.
I don’t trust my answer yet.
Opinion still buffering.
Thinking sounds exhausting.
Conserving brain cells.
Choosing rest over replies.
Protecting my peace.
Too abstract for today.
Too detailed for my patience.
Too trivial to engage.
Not relevant to my life.
That feels like unpaid labor.
Plate is already full.
Focus is elsewhere.
No time for this.
Everything is rushed already.
Too much noise right now.
You broke my flow.
Multitasking is a lie.
That’s emotional labor.
That requires vulnerability I don’t have.
Doesn’t feel safe to answer.
Smells like a trap.
Intent unclear, declining.
That’s criticism wearing a hat.
Is this an interrogation?
I didn’t study for this.
Not doing homework.
Again? Really?
That feels validation-fishy.
That feels reaction-fishy.
I’m not performing today.
Not here to be judged.
Not taking responsibility for this outcome.
Not setting that precedent.
I’m not committing to that.
Please don’t quote me.
Nuance is too much work.
Oversimplifying would feel wrong.
Not oversharing today.
Closed for emotional business.
Too tired to type thoughts.
Currently unwell, mentally or otherwise.
Ask me after snacks.
Overstimulated and done.
Social meter is empty.
Choosing silence.
Temporarily disengaged.
Boundary enforced.
Avoiding confusion on purpose.
Not escalating this.
I just don’t feel like it.
